Scenario: Your extraction system implements automatic retries when validation fails. On each retry, the specific validation error is appended to the prompt. This retry-with-error-feedback approach resolves most failures within 2-3 attempts. For which failure pattern would additional retries be LEAST effective?

---

[ ] A - The model extracts keywords as a nested object organized by category when the schema requires a flat array of strings
[ ] B - The model extracts citation counts as locale-formatted strings ("1,234") when the schema requires integers
[ ] C - The model extracts dates as ISO 8601 datetime strings ("2023-03-15T00:00:00Z") when the schema requires only the date portion (YYYY-MM-DD)
[ ] D - The model extracts "et al." for co-authors when the full list exists only in an external document not in the input
