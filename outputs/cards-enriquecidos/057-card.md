Scenario: Your system extracts event metadata (date, location, organizer, `attendee_count`) from news articles using a JSON schema with all nullable fields. During evaluation, you observe the model frequently generates plausible but incorrect values for fields not mentioned in the article—for example, outputting "500" for `attendee_count` when the source contains no attendance information. What's the most effective way to reduce these false extractions?

---

[ ] A - Add a post-processing step using a second LLM call to verify each extracted value exists in the source document.
[ ] B - Add prompt instructions to return null for any field where information is not directly stated in the source.
[ ] C - Make all schema fields required (non-nullable) with strict validation rules to ensure the model only outputs verifiable data.
[ ] D - Upgrade to a more capable model tier with improved instruction-following to reduce hallucination tendencies.
